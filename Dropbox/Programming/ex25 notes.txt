Defining lots of functions within a module

""" - These are now also called documentation comments and can be used
		to leave comments  similar to those found in the pydoc help
	- In order to access them one must first import the file (ex25), then
		you can type 'help(ex25)' and all of the comments show up

import * - This will import all functions within the defined module, that way
			you do not have to type module.function() every time you want to
			use a function; can leave off the module and just use function()
			i.e. 'from ex25 import *' 
CTRL-D - quits python, can also enter function 'quit()' and hit return
			(CTRL-Z on Windows)

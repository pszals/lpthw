Why won't this work?

def secret_formula(started):
    jelly_beans = started * 500
    jars = jelly_beans / 1000
    crates = jars / 100
    return jelly_beans, jars, crates

print "We'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates %s." % (
	secret_formula(start_point), 'extra')
	
Error:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex24.py", line 50, in <module>
    secret_formula(start_point), 'extra')
TypeError: %d format: a number is required, not tuple

But this does work:

def secret_formula(started):
    jelly_beans = started * 500
    jars = jelly_beans / 1000
    crates = jars / 100
    return jelly_beans, jars, crates

start_point = 10000
beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)

print "We'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates %s." % (
	beans, jars, crates, 'extra')

the function opening_scene from the Map() class. Next, a while loop is created
that puts a line between each scene. Every scene has the function enter()
followed by text and a call to action, thus the next scene name is determined
by what gets returned from the enter() function in the current scene, namely, 
a key to the next scene in the dictionary in the Map() class.

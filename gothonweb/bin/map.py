You find yourself in the Central Corridor after having justwitnessed the murder
of your best friend at the hands of a slimy Gothon. You had quickly run away,
fighting back tears, only to run into another Gothon who is blocking your path.
You know from your third grade Univers History class that a Gothon's biggest 
weakness is its sense of humor. You decide to tell it a corny joke. 'What's 
brown and sticky?' You seem to have caught the Gothon by surprise. It 
contemplates for a moment, then gives up. 'A stick!' you counter.

You have reached the armory. In it you see a vaguely familiar symbol. You 
recall learning about it in your fourth grade particle physics class, but can't
quite place it. 'Aha!' you think to yourself. 'That symbol means radioactive!'
A neutron bomb? That might do the trick. But it's locked up - you must guess 
the right number on the key pad to access it. Numbers 1-9. Choose the right 
number, quick!

You have reached the final staging area. This is where you must plant the bomb

and families. In a moment of hesitation though, you realize that the Gothons 
probably have friends and family too. Do you really want to blow them all up?

Congratulations. GAME OVER.
